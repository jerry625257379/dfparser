== README

General:
  1. The runtime website, you can refer to http://www.52wapp.com:3000/
Copy and paste your `df` command result on Linux system, and then the website will tell you the file system that used more than 80\%, with less 2G
  2. It's an demo application to learn rails + angularJS + coffeeJS
  3. The version is ruby1.9.3, rails 4.1.4

A little more explanation:
  1. The frontend framework is MVC with angularJS + CoffeeJS, it just accept the input, and display the output. It will parser the data via a API to ruby to get the parser result.
  2. The backend framework is rails, it will render the website to user, and also supply an API to parser the df command result, and return it

The roadmap that I set up the app

Preparetion
1. Preparetion
  a. Find some merterial about Rails, Angular. The followling lik is good tutor for a beginner of Rails + AngularJS totior
  https://github.com/asanderson15/rails-angular-tutorial

2. Set up the enviroment
  a. First I try to openshift.
    a) I create Application on openshift ruby-sjj, but it also requires me to install the rails enviroment on my local machine. That's the nightmare
    b) Install Rails, I got many problems. Can't install rails due the lack of ruby-dev, can't install ruby-dev due g++ extension error, can't install. The I decided to give up windows. After that, I happended read the artical https://ruby-china.org/topics/1020, it proves it's smart move.
    c) The I move to develop on the openshift, after I try create git app, and rails app with permession denied, I believe it's virtual space rather than virtual machien.
Finally, I decided to use my remote virtual machine ubuntu.

  b. How to install Rails on Ubuntu
    apt-get update
    apt-get install ruby1.9
    gem install rails

3. Create App
Create new project dfparser by following the tutior https://github.com/asanderson15/rails-angular-tutorial
  a. Create angular controller under the frontend folder app/assets/javascript
  b. Create the main ruby view file
  c. Create coffeeJS for send request
  d. Create the ruby controller
    Learn the ruby grammer about how to deal with text, the number

4. Deploy it to the ubuntu
  a. I try to deploy it with Nginxï¼Œ it  pop up there's error, I don't find out the reason.
  b. At last, I just deploy it with nohup command.
